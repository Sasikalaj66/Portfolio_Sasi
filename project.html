            <h3>Project 1</h3> 
            <p>Project on "Smart Street Light and Fault Detection with Location Tracking" at KEC.</p> 
                <p>•It can automatically report when the lights are not working.Then pinpoint their own location, making it easy to find and fix them. </p>  
                <p>•Real time monitoring ensures efficient energy management and enchanced pubic safety.</p>

            <h3>Project 2</h3>
            <p>Project on "Crop Health Analyzer for Tomato Leaf Disease and Weed Identification using Machine Learning" at KEC. </p>
                <p>By replacing traditional manual inspection methods, this technology significantly reduces the time, labor and human error involved in crop monitoring,ensuring healthier crops and improving yields using YOLOv8 algorithm.</p>
